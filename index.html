        <span class='cool'></span> This is a simulation of the spread of Physarum polycephalum, a slime mold A.K.A. the blob. It's an organism that is not an animal, nor a plant, nor a fungus. 
        Its known for its ability to create efficient and intelligent networks and solving "shortest path" problems. 

      </p>
  
      <p> <span class='cool'>How to use the simulation</span>
      <ul>
        <li> Click anywhere on the black square to create a root blob.</li>
        <li> Hold Shift and click anywhere to delete cells.</li>
        <li> Hold Alt and click anywhere to create a permanent emitter root blob</li>
        <li> Click on the CLEAR button to clear the screen.</li>
        <li> Click on the RANDOM button to randomize the clusters.</li>
        <li> You can edit r, decayT, SA, RA, and SS to change the slime mold's behavior.</li>
        

      </ul>

        This simulation is based on the cellular automata model.
        The plane is composed of two layers: the chemoattractant trail layer and the position layer.

        Every slime node has three sensors. A sensor detects the amount of chemoattractant in its sensor's area. The slime moves forward according to its sensors' values. 
        <br>A slime node starts by "sensing" (evaluating the values of its sensors)
        <br>
        If the middle sensor detects the most chemoattractant out of the 3 sensors, it doesn't change direction.
        <br>
        If both side sensors detect more chemoattractant than the middle sensor and both detect the same amount, it turns randomly.
        <br>
        If the right sensor detects more chemoattractant than the middle sensor, it turns right.
        <br>
        If the left sensor detects more chemoattractant than the middle sensor, it turns left.
        <br>
        Then it moves forward according to that direction according to some step size value.

        Then it deposits chemoattractants on the chemoattractant trail layer. 

        Then the chemoattractant diffuses (spreads out to its surroundings) and slowly decays.
